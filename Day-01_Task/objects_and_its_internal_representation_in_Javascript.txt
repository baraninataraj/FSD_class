In JavaScript, objects are fundamental entities that represent collections of key-value pairs, 
allowing for the organisation and manipulation of data. Understanding how objects are internally
represented is crucial for mastering JavaScript development.
Let's delve into the internal representation of objects in JavaScript:

Properties and Methods:
   - Objects in JavaScript consist of properties and methods.
   - Properties are key-value pairs where the key is always a string (or symbol) and the value can be any data type.
   - Methods are functions associated with an object, allowing for behaviour encapsulation.
