In JavaScript, objects are fundamental entities that represent collections of key-value pairs, 
allowing for the organisation and manipulation of data. Understanding how objects are internally
represented is crucial for mastering JavaScript development.
Let's delve into the internal representation of objects in JavaScript:

Properties and Methods:
   - Objects in JavaScript consist of properties and methods.
   - Properties are key-value pairs where the key is always a string (or symbol) and the value can be any data type.
   - Methods are functions associated with an object, allowing for behaviour encapsulation.

Object Prototype:
   - Each object in JavaScript has an internal reference to another object called its prototype.
   - If a property or method is not found in the object itself, JavaScript looks for it in the prototype object.
   - This process continues recursively along the prototype chain until the property or method is found or until the end of the chain (null).

Object Creation:
   - Objects can be created using constructor functions, object literals, or ES6 classes.
   - Constructor functions are functions used to initialise objects with specific properties and methods.
   - Object literals provide a concise syntax for creating objects directly without using constructor functions.
   - ES6 classes offer a more intuitive and class-based approach to object creation and inheritance.

Accessing Properties:
   - Properties of an object can be accessed using dot notation (e.g., `object.property`) or bracket notation (e.g., `object['property']`).
   - Dot notation is commonly used when the property name is known beforehand, while bracket notation is useful for dynamic property access.


Object Mutation:
   - Objects in JavaScript are mutable, meaning their properties and methods can be modified, added, or removed after creation.
   - This mutability allows for dynamic changes to objects, facilitating flexible data manipulation.


Performance Considerations:
   - Accessing deeply nested properties or methods, or traversing long prototype chains, can impact performance.
   - Care should be taken to optimise object access patterns, especially in performance-critical applications.
   - Memory management is crucial for managing object creation and avoiding memory leaks, particularly for large object graphs.

In essence, objects in JavaScript serve as versatile data structures, offering a flexible and powerful means of organising and manipulating data.
Understanding their internal representation, including properties, methods, prototype chains, and creation patterns, 
is essential for effective JavaScript development. By mastering the nuances of object representation,
developers can leverage the full potential of JavaScript to build robust and scalable applications.
